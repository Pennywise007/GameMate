## Overview

GameMate is a powerful Windows application designed to enhance your productivity and gaming experience. It allows you to customize key bindings for different applications, add a crosshair overlay for games, block accidental key presses, track your time efficiently, and automate complex sequences of actions.

## Features

- Per-Application Key Bindings: Assign unique key bindings for each application. For example, you can set up a series of actions for Notepad using the key '8', and configure different actions for Excel using the same key, without any interference.

- Crosshair Overlay: Display a crosshair in the center of the screen when a specified application (like a game) is active. Ensure you always have a precise aim.

- Accidental Key Press Blocker: Specify a list of keys to be blocked to prevent accidental presses in each application. For instance, disable the Windows key while playing a game to avoid disruptions.

- Time Tracker: Start a timer to monitor and manage the time spent on each application.

- Advanced Action Automation: Create complex automation sequences that go beyond simple clicks. Include mouse movements, key presses, and script executions to automate repetitive tasks in any application.
